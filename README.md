Blockchain Application Dev: building a webapp using NodeJs and Solidity
This is an web-dapp to implement a online market place on the blockchain. The front-end uses NodeJs, handlebars and MongoDB.

## Requirements
* Mongo 
  * Install mongoDB go to the official website and download the setup.
  * Install and make sure /data/db folder option is selected, else you will have
  to create it manually.
  * To start mongoDB, you must go to the install folder and run both the
  mongod and mongo.exe file.
<p> We need to navigate to the folder where mongoDB is installed and through the
command line run both mongod and mongo. Alternatively, you could add it to the
path in the environment variables on windows or add it to your $PATH in Linux.
Doing so would allow you to launch mongo and mongod from any path. Install
Node.js and make sure both mongo and mongoDB are running.</p>

* Robomongo 
  * Robomongo is the free lightweight GUI for MongoDB enthusiasts.
  * Robomongo is used to visualize how the databases look and we can delete
    items from the GUI.
